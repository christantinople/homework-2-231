## Linear Regression

For this lab, we will be working with a data set from the UCI (University of California, Irvine) Machine Learning repository ([see website here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)). The full data set consists of $4,177$ observations of abalone in Tasmania. (Fun fact: [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania "Tasmania") supplies about $25\%$ of the yearly world abalone harvest.)

![*Fig 1. Inside of an abalone shell.*](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1198/8002/products/1d89434927bffb6fd1786c19c2d921fb_2000x_652a2391-5a0a-4f10-966c-f759dc08635c_1024x1024.jpg?v=1582320404){width="152"}

The age of an abalone is typically determined by cutting the shell open and counting the number of rings with a microscope. The purpose of this data set is to determine whether abalone age (**number of rings + 1.5**) can be accurately predicted using other, easier-to-obtain information about the abalone.

The full abalone data set is located in the `\data` subdirectory. Read it into *R* using `read_csv()`. Take a moment to read through the codebook (`abalone_codebook.txt`) and familiarize yourself with the variable definitions.

Make sure you load the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`!

### Question 1

Your goal is to predict abalone age, which is calculated as the number of rings plus 1.5. Notice there currently is no `age` variable in the data set. Add `age` to the data set.

Assess and describe the distribution of `age`.

```{r}
abalone <- read_csv(file = "data/abalone.csv")
abalone <- abalone %>%
  mutate(age = rings+1.5)
abalone %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram()+
  ggtitle("Abalone Age Frequency")
```

The distribution is roughly bell shaped, but it does have a right skew. The mode age seems to be around 11 years of age and most abalone are under 15 years of age.

### Question 2

Split the abalone data into a training set and a testing set. Use stratified sampling. You should decide on appropriate percentages for splitting the data.

*Remember that you'll need to set a seed at the beginning of the document to reproduce your results.*
```{r}
set.seed(42069) # for reproducibility

# get stratified train/testing sets
abalone_split <- initial_split(abalone, prop = 0.80,
                                strata = age)
abalone_train <- training(abalone_split)
abaone_test <- testing(abalone_split)
```

### Question 3

Using the **training** data, create a recipe predicting the outcome variable, `age`, with all other predictor variables. Note that you should not include `rings` to predict `age`. Explain why you shouldn't use `rings` to predict `age`.

Steps for your recipe:

1.  dummy code any categorical predictors

2.  create interactions between

    -   `type` and `shucked_weight`,
    -   `longest_shell` and `diameter`,
    -   `shucked_weight` and `shell_weight`

3.  center all predictors, and

4.  scale all predictors.

You'll need to investigate the `tidymodels` documentation to find the appropriate step functions to use.

We shouldn't use `rings` because our response variable `age`, is a linear transformation of `rings`.

```{r}
abalone_recipe <- recipe(age ~ ., data = abalone_train%>%select(-rings)) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())%>%
  step_interact(terms = ~ starts_with("type"):shucked_weight + longest_shell:diameter + shucked_weight:shell_weight)%>%
  step_center(all_predictors())%>%
  step_scale(all_predictors())
```

### Question 4

Create and store a linear regression object using the `"lm"` engine.

```{r}
lm_model <- linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm")
```

### Question 5

Now:

1.  set up an empty workflow,
2.  add the model you created in Question 4, and
3.  add the recipe that you created in Question 3.

```{r}
lm_wflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(lm_model) %>% 
  add_recipe(abalone_recipe)
```

### Question 6

Use your `fit()` object to predict the age of a hypothetical female abalone with longest_shell = 0.50, diameter = 0.10, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, shell_weight = 1.

```{r}
lm_fit <- fit(lm_wflow, abalone_train%>%select(-rings))
new_abalone <- data.frame(type="F", longest_shell = 0.50, diameter = 0.10, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, shell_weight = 1,stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
pred <- predict(lm_fit, new_data = new_abalone)
pred
```

### Question 7

Now you want to assess your model's performance. To do this, use the `yardstick` package:

1.  Create a metric set that includes *R^2^*, RMSE (root mean squared error), and MAE (mean absolute error).
2.  Use `predict()` and `bind_cols()` to create a tibble of your model's predicted values from the **training data** along with the actual observed ages (these are needed to assess your model's performance).
3.  Finally, apply your metric set to the tibble, report the results, and interpret the *R^2^* value.

```{r}
abalone_train_res <- predict(lm_fit, new_data = abalone_train %>% select(-age,-rings))%>%
  bind_cols(abalone_train%>%select(age))

abalone_metrics <- metric_set(rmse, rsq, mae)
abalone_metrics(abalone_train_res, truth = age, 
                estimate = .pred)
```
We have that $R^2 = 0.5533$ which means that about 55% of the variability in the response variable (`age`) is explained by our model.

### Required for 231 Students

In lecture, we presented the general bias-variance tradeoff, which takes the form:

$$
E[(y_0 - \hat{f}(x_0))^2]=Var(\hat{f}(x_0))+[Bias(\hat{f}(x_0))]^2+Var(\epsilon)
$$

where the underlying model $Y=f(X)+\epsilon$ satisfies the following:

- $\epsilon$ is a zero-mean random noise term and $X$ is non-random (all randomness in $Y$ comes from $\epsilon$);
- $(x_0, y_0)$ represents a test observation, independent of the training set, drawn from the same model;
- $\hat{f}(.)$ is the estimate of $f$ obtained from the training set.

#### Question 8

Which term(s) in the bias-variance tradeoff above represent the reproducible error? Which term(s) represent the irreducible error?

**Answer:** The reducible error is represented by $\text{Var}(\hat{f}(x_0))+\text{Bias}^2(\hat{f}(x_0))$ and the irreducible error is represented by $\text{Var}(\epsilon)$.

#### Question 9

Using the bias-variance tradeoff above, demonstrate that the expected test error is always at least as large as the irreducible error.

**Answer:** Note that variance is inherently a nonnegative
quantity, and squared bias is also nonnegative. Hence, we see that the
expected test MSE can never lie below Var($\epsilon$), the irreducible error.

#### Question 10

Prove the bias-variance tradeoff.

Hints:

- use the definition of $Bias(\hat{f}(x_0))=E[\hat{f}(x_0)]-f(x_0)$;
- reorganize terms in the expected test error by adding and subtracting $E[\hat{f}(x_0)]$

**Answer:** We have that
\begin{align*}
  E[(y_0 - \hat{f}(x_0))^2] &= E[((f(x_0) + \epsilon) - \hat{f}(x_0))^2]\\
  &= E[((f(x_0) - \hat{f}(x_0) + \epsilon)^2]\\
  &= E[(f(x_0) - \hat{f}(x_0))^2] + \underbrace{E[(f(x_0) - \hat{f}(x_0))\epsilon]}_{=E[(f(x_0) - \hat{f}(x_0))]E[\epsilon] = 0} + \underbrace{E[\epsilon^2]}_{=\text{Var}(\epsilon)}\\
  &= E[f^2(x_0) -2f(x_0)\hat{f}(x_0) + \hat{f}^2(x_0)] + \text{Var}(\epsilon)\\
  &= f^2(x_0)-2f(x_0)E[\hat{f}(x_0)]\phantom{+E[\hat{f}(x_0)]^2p}+E[\hat{f}^2(x_0)] \phantom{-E[\hat{f}(x_0)]^2r} + \text{Var}(\epsilon) \\
  &= \underbrace{f^2(x_0)-2f(x_0)E[\hat{f}(x_0)]+E[\hat{f}(x_0)]^2}_{(E[\hat{f}(x_0)] - f(x_0))^2}+E[\hat{f}^2(x_0)]-E[\hat{f}(x_0)]^2 + \text{Var}(\epsilon)\\
  &= \text{Bias}^2(\hat{f}(x_0)) + \text{Var}(\hat{f}(x_0)) + \text{Var}(\epsilon)
\end{align*}
